## About the Project

This personal portfolio website serves as a comprehensive digital resume, meticulously designed to present my professional work, technical proficiencies, and relevant experience to prospective employers and collaborators. As a current MCA student at Manipal University, Jaipur, with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, I am deeply engaged in the world of data analytics and machine learning. My internship at SkillFied Mentor provided a strong foundation in data exploration, visualization, and interpretation. I am passionate about leveraging technology to make complex subjects accessible, a skill I've honed as the founder of JHT SMART STEPS LEARNING. This platform is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA), leveraging contemporary web technologies to deliver a fluid and engaging user experience, and highlights my eagerness to apply analytical skills to new challenges in the AI and ML space.

## Getting Started

To set up and run this project locally, please follow the detailed instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed on your development machine:

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended, e.g., v18.x or higher)  
- **npm** (Node Package Manager, typically bundled with Node.js) or **Yarn**

---

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-portfolio-repo.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-portfolio-repo
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Configure Firebase (if applicable):
   If your project integrates with Firebase Firestore, it is imperative to establish a Firebase project and configure your credentials.
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and populate it with your Firebase configuration variables (e.g., `VITE_API_KEY`, `VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, etc.).

5. Initiate the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

The application will typically become accessible at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

---

### Usage

Upon successful execution, the application allows for seamless navigation through various portfolio sections: About, Experience, Skills, Projects, Certificates, and Contact. For users with administrative privileges (as indicated by the project editing interface), the platform enables direct addition, modification, and comprehensive management of project details.

### Deployment

This project has been architected for straightforward deployment to a variety of static site hosting services.

1. Generate production build:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

   This command will compile and optimize your application, generating a `dist` folder containing all necessary files for production deployment.

2. Select a hosting provider:
   Highly recommended free hosting solutions include:

   * Vercel
   * Netlify
   * Cloudflare Pages
   * GitHub Pages (ideal for static content)

3. Adhere to the specific deployment guidelines provided by your chosen hosting service.
   Typically, this involves connecting your Git repository, after which the service will automatically build and deploy the contents of your `dist` folder.
